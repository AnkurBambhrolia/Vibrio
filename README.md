## 📌 Project Overview  
This capstone project analyzes the environmental risk factors associated with *Vibrio vulnificus*, a deadly marine bacterium whose prevalence is increasing due to climate change. The study integrates public health surveillance data with environmental datasets to understand trends and forecast future outbreaks along the Eastern U.S. coastline.

We used tools such as Python (Google Colab), MySQL, and Power BI to clean, analyze, and visualize the data. The project is presented in multiple formats:

- 📄 **[Final Report (PDF)](./Vibrio_Vulnificus_Research_Paper.pdf)** — A comprehensive written analysis  
- 📊 **[Power BI Dashboard](./Vibrio_Dashboard.pbix)** — Visual exploration of trends, correlations, and forecasts  
- 📽️ **[Research Presentation](https://youtu.be/usGh6bckTsk)** — A presentation of our journey into Vibrio Vulnificus and ecoinformatics

## 🧪 Methods and Tools  
- **Data Sources**: CDC (BEAM), NOAA (SST), NASA (SSS)  
- **Languages/Tools**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn), MySQL Workbench, Power BI  
- **Forecasting Models**: SARIMAX, Random Forest, XGBoost, Prophet

## 🔍 Key Findings  
- Rising **Sea Surface Temperature (SST)** is strongly correlated with increased *V. vulnificus* cases  
- **Salinity (SSS)** shows a weaker but relevant inverse relationship  
- Time series forecasting predicts seasonal patterns with a gradual rise in risk  
- SARIMAX offered the most accurate forecast, incorporating both environmental and seasonal trends
